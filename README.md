It's an remote volume trigger

We all switch off the volume of our devices when we are busy or sleeping. Sometimes we often forget to turn the volume on. And at times, for the silence mood - we are not reachable during emergencies. 

This app would give the user to create a whitelist/auth-code which would enable selected few contacts to remotely turn on the volume via a preset passcode which would be send via SMS

Features
=======
- Remotely turning the volume on
- Add a whitelist or enable for everyone
- Ability to set your own passcode

To-do
